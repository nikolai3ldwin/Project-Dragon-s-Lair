              We are Project Dragon's Lair! This idea inspired while pumping
              iron in the gym. Highly recommended place to think about your
              place in the universe. More importantl, this idea was to study
              learning in a virtual reality environment. It was hypothesized
              that experience would help people to feel more connected and
              involved in their learning -- with their peers and their teacher
              -- and that this would promote better learning in a world that is
              currently taking shelter from a pandemic. A horrible thought, is
              what if this happens again? Studies already show that learning was
              behind, that the general public's mental and emotional health was
              worsened from the experience, and that people's futures were being
              impaired.

              Project Dragon's Lair sees people as just that. People. People
              have stories to tell and share. We hope to create a platform where
              people can learn together, work together, and play together. Help
              collaborate and build with us to realize this.
            </p>

              Let us know how we can help you to tell your stories and connect
              with your peers in whichever environment you need. Consultations
              allow us to help you.
